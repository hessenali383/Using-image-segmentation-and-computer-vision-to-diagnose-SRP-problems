# Using-image-segmentation-and-computer-vision-to-diagnose-SRP-problems
This model predicts Suker rod pump problems by using dynamometer card data for diagnosis. Initially, the model performs image segmentation to convert the cards from lines into shapes that are easier to classify, and then it is trained on multiple groups, each representing a specific diagnosis for the card.
